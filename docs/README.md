## FAQ
**Q**. Why is my Aurora application not running?

**A**. Here are some steps you can use to troubleshoot your issue:
1. Ensure that you have Java 11 installed on your device.
2. Check that you have "write" access in the folder you downloaded Aurora to.
3. Ensure that Aurora is creating a "data" folder within the folder you downloaded Aurora to.

**Q**. What happens when I delete a task associated with another DoAfter task?

**A**. No worries, Aurora is programmed to indicate that your task associated with the DoAfter task has been deleted 
previously. It will not affect the application.

**Q**. How should I interpret the entries on the task list?

**A**. The entries on the task list have a general format: 

```[Type of task]['X' if done, blank if not done] {Description} (Further description based on type of task)```

**Q**. Is it possible to transfer my task list from one device to another?

**A**. Of course! The task list is stored as a text file named aurora within the data folder created by the 
application. Simply transfer the data folder into your new device, into the same folder as your intend to download 
Aurora into, and you will be able to access the same task list.

**Q**. What happens when I enter a random command that isn't included in the user guide into the application?

**A**. Aurora will express that she doesn't understand what you are referring to and provide a list of valid 
commands for you to use.
